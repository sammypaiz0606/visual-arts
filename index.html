				<p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charlse and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture, Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>

				<p class='para2'>That look and their relationship with Herman Millier started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York</p>
				<br />
				<p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?</p>

				<p>Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".</p>
				<br />
				<p>Adesign critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place". That also made it a lot more interesting.</p>
